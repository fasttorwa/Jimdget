# Jimdget

In order to make Jimdget run:

- Close the simulator if you have trouble (re)starting the app
- Enable the 'App Groups' Capability on both (Jimdget & JMDStatsExtension) targets ans make sure they share a common container.
  In case entitlement generation fails go to the developer portal and add by hand.
